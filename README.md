# Weather_Dashboard
Weather Dashboard app using Open Weather API and Materialize library

## Notes
This is a weather app which generates two fetch requests from Open Weather API, one for geocoding the searched city, the other for pulling weather data for the returned location.  A current weather and 5-day forecast are then generated with basic weather information.  Previous searches are then saved in local storage, which can be clicked on to run a fetch request on saved latitude and longitue.
